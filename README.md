VIRTUAL MEMORY IMPLEMENTATION COMPUTER ORGANIZATION 
Andy Lemmon, Omoju Miller, Joseph Qualls 

OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to add a minimalist operating system layer to the computer simulation that has been created during the class programming assignments. Since one of the most important aspects of any operating system is the functionality of the virtual memory management, we have decided to focus on that portion of the OS for the final project.
This simple virtual memory implementation will be limited to a RAM of 512 bytes, a swap file of 4096 bytes as well as a disk space of 4096 bytes.
